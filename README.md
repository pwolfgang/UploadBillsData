# Pennsylvania Policy Database Upload Bills Data Tool.

This is a stand-alone program to upload the data from the Pennsylvania Legislature Web Site bill history xml file to the PAPolicy_Copy database. It includes the analysis of the bill history to determine the final state of the bill in both the legislature houses and the governor.
